import InstallChecksumVerification from "@site/src/components/InstallChecksumVerification";

Currently, SAReq can be installed using one of the following two methods:

1. Using `go install`
2. Downloading pre-built binaries

## Using `go install`

To install SAReq using this method, ensure you have a latest version of [Go](https://go.dev/) installed on your system. Then, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
go install github.com/im-varun/sareq@latest
```

To verify the installation, you can run:
```sh
sareq --version
# or sareq version
```
This should display the installed version of SAReq.

## Downloading Pre-built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for SAReq are available for various operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) and architectures (amd64, arm64), and can be downloaded directly from SAReq's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/im-varun/sareq/releases) page.

Follow these steps to ensure a successful installation:

1. Navigate to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/im-varun/sareq/releases) page of SAReq.

2. Download the appropriate archive file for your operating system and architecture along with its corresponding `.sha256` checksum file.

3. Verify the integrity of the downloaded archive using the SHA256 checksum provided in the `.sha256` file. To do this, make sure the archive file and the `.sha256` file are in the same directory, then run the following command based on your operating system:
    <InstallChecksumVerification />
    Compare the output hash with the contents of the `.sha256` file to ensure they match. If they do not match, please do not proceed with the installation steps below, and instead, re-download the files.

4. Once the checksum is verified, extract the contents of the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.

5. Add the directory containing the extracted `sareq` executable to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run SAReq from any terminal window.

6. To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:
    ```sh
    sareq --version
    # or sareq version
    ```
    This should display the installed version of SAReq indicating that the installation was successful.

## Other Installation Methods

Support for additional installation methods, such as package managers like Scoop and Homebrew, is currently under development. Stay tuned for updates in future releases!
